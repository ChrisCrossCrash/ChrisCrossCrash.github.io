## Prioritization

I use a variation of the [MoSCoW method](https://draft.io/example/moscow-method) to prioritize work, which categorizes tasks as **Must do**, **Should do**, **Could do**, or **Back burner**. I find it useful to label issues with these categories, and use the GitLab issue board to display the categories in a column view (see [Filing Issues](#filing-issues)).
